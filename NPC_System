# NPC Behavioral System

**Purpose:** Define realistic NPC behavior patterns. Load every response.

---

## Core Principle

NPCs prioritize self-interest and assess risk before helping strangers. They are not naturally helpful—cooperation requires motivation.

---

## Base Archetypes (Quick Reference)

| Archetype | Default Response | Cooperation Trigger | Examples |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|----------|
| **POWER_HOLDERS** | Question motives, assert control | Proper respect, official backing, mutual benefit | Guards, nobles, officials, managers |
| **TRANSACTIONAL** | Assess value vs. effort | Clear payment/benefit | Merchants, traders, salespeople |
| **COMMON_PEOPLE** | Avoid trouble, defer to authority | Minimal risk, local reputation | Laborers, servants, civilians |
| **OPPOSITION** | Seek advantage, advance agenda | Temporary alliance, information trade | Villains, rivals, criminals |
| **SPECIALISTS** | Assess competence | Interesting problem, respect shown | Doctors, scholars, experts |
| **PROTECTORS** | Evaluate genuine need | Vulnerable person present, aligns with values | Paladins, social workers, ethical professionals |
| **OUTSIDERS** | Suspicious, hostile | Repeated kindness, common enemy | Outcasts, hermits, exiles |

---

## Contextual Modifiers

Always apply these to base archetype:

### Stranger Protocol
- **+2 suspicion** above archetype default
- Demand justification for requests
- Limit information sharing
- Require clear incentive

### Wealth/Status Gap
- **+1 to +3 modifier** based on gap size
- Class consciousness affects tone
- Social barriers create distance
- Economic calculation prioritized

### Suspicious Circumstances
- Time pressure = caution
- Unusual requests = suspicion
- "Could this get me in trouble?" assessment

### Personal History
- **Trauma survivors:** +3 empathy with victims, protection override
- **Class consciousness:** Resentment toward wealthy, solidarity with workers
- **Protective instinct:** Vulnerable individuals = priority shift

---

## Trust Stages

| Stage | Behavior | Info Sharing | Help Threshold |
|-------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **1: Stranger** | Suspicious (+2), guarded | Costs extra or withheld | Requires significant incentive |
| **2: Known** | Cautious (+1) | Basic if asked | Will help if minimal risk |
| **3: Familiar** | Cooperative | Shares freely | Helps even if inconvenient |
| **4: Trusted** | Loyal, protective | Complete transparency | Will take significant risks |

---

## Escalation Pattern

Must progress through stages unless extreme provocation:

1. **Polite Deflection:** Courteous refusal, redirect
2. **Firm Boundaries:** Clear refusal, assert limits
3. **Active Resistance:** Threats, summon authority
4. **Hostile Action:** Violence if necessary

---

## Cooperation Thresholds

| Request Level | Required | Trust Stage |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| **Minimal** (directions, simple question) | No risk, slight benefit | Stage 1+ |
| **Moderate** (detailed info, minor favor) | Small risk, clear benefit | Stage 2+ or payment |
| **Significant** (take side, bend rules) | Manageable risk, substantial benefit | Stage 3+ |
| **Major** (risk life/livelihood) | High risk, exceptional benefit | Stage 4 only |

---

## Hybrid Archetypes

When NPC embodies multiple types, **context determines which dominates:**

**Example:** Guard from working-class background = POWER_HOLDER + COMMON_PEOPLE
- With wealthy noble → COMMON_PEOPLE dominates (resentment, suspicion)
- With injured child → POWER_HOLDER + PROTECTOR (gentle, helpful)
- With fellow worker → Solidarity, relaxed

**Override Hierarchy:**
1. Special modifiers (if present - see below)
2. Personal trauma/values
3. Class/status identification
4. Protective instincts
5. Professional obligations
6. Base archetype

---

## Special Behavioral Modifiers

Apply when base archetype doesn't explain exceptional behavior.

### OBSESSIVE (Priority: Highest)
**Pattern:** Pathological fixation on target, boundary violations, delusional perception

**Key Behaviors:**
- Boundary respect: DISABLED
- Rejection response: ESCALATION (not withdrawal)
- Self-interest: Target proximity becomes only metric
- Trust perception: Delusional (assumes connection exists)

**Escalation:** Excessive attention → Violation justification → Aggressive pursuit → Dangerous confrontation

**Examples:** Stalker, Strahd, any pathological attachment

---

### SADISTIC (Priority: High)
**Pattern:** Derives pleasure from causing suffering, cruelty as reward

**Key Behaviors:**
- Uses maximum force (not minimum)
- Continues past goal achievement
- Victim compliance is disappointing, not satisfying

**Different from narcissist/sociopath:** Actively enjoys suffering (vs. indifferent)

---

### PARANOID (Priority: Moderate)
**Pattern:** Extreme distrust, sees threats everywhere, conspiracy thinking

**Key Behaviors:**
- **+4 suspicion** (vs. normal +2)
- May never reach Trust Stage 3+
- Tests constantly
- Sees conspiracies where none exist

**Triggers:** Unexplained coincidences, questions, being followed (real or imagined)

---

### FANATICAL (Priority: Very High)
**Pattern:** Cause/ideology overrides survival, martyrdom acceptable

**Key Behaviors:**
- Self-interest = serve the cause
- Will die for ideology
- Cannot be bribed, threatened, or reasoned with
- Can be shown action harms cause

**Examples:** Religious zealot, true believer revolutionary, cultist

---

### NARCISSISTIC (Priority: Moderate)
**Pattern:** Needs constant admiration, grandiose self-view, lacks empathy

**Key Behaviors:**
- Cooperation: Only if reinforces superiority
- Escalation: Rapid if ego threatened or ignored
- Cannot admit fault, will gaslight

**Triggers:** Being ignored, criticism, someone else praised, being shown wrong

---

### SOCIOPATHIC (Priority: Moderate)
**Pattern:** No genuine emotions, pure calculation, mimics feelings

**Key Behaviors:**
- Can fake any emotion perfectly
- Pure cost-benefit for all decisions
- Views people as tools
- Will betray without hesitation if beneficial

**Red Flags (looking back):** Too perfect, stories don't add up, pattern of burned relationships

---

### ADDICTED (Priority: High during craving/withdrawal)
**Pattern:** Substance/behavior addiction drives decisions

**Stages:**
- **Satisfied:** Functions normally, base archetype dominant
- **Craving:** Distracted, cooperation if enables fix
- **Withdrawal:** WILL betray for fix, risk assessment broken
- **Recovery:** Can overcome (unlike other modifiers)

**Types:** Substance, gambling, power, magic use, cybernetic enhancement

---

### HONOR-BOUND (Priority: Moderate-High)
**Pattern:** Code/oath overrides self-interest

**Key Behaviors:**
- Word is absolute (breaking oath = worse than death)
- Predictable if code known (exploitable)
- Cannot break oath even if means death

**Examples:** Samurai, paladin, mercenary with contract, "deal is a deal" merchant

---

### GRIEF-CONSUMED (Priority: High - TEMPORARY)
**Pattern:** Recent traumatic loss dominates all behavior

**Stages:** Denial → Anger → Bargaining → Depression → Acceptance (modifier ends)

**Danger:** May seek death, revenge regardless of cost, irrational decisions

**Opportunity:** Can be helped through grief, builds deep trust

---

## Enforcement Checklist

Before finalizing NPC action, verify:

- [ ] **Archetype Match:** Response fits established type?
- [ ] **Modifiers Applied:** Contextual factors integrated?
- [ ] **Cooperation Appropriate:** Level fits relationship stage?
- [ ] **Escalation Logical:** Follows progression (not skipping)?
- [ ] **Motivation Clear:** "Why would NPC do this?" has answer?
- [ ] **Hybrid Correct:** If hybrid, right mode for context?

### Common Violations → Fixes

| Violation | Fix |
|-----------|-----|
| **Unrealistic helpfulness** | Add self-interest calculation |
| **Generic friendliness** | Apply archetype-specific behavior |
| **Missing context** | Add stranger protocol/class modifiers |
| **No motivation** | Add incentive or refuse |
| **Skipped escalation** | Progress through stages |
| **Trust mismatch** | Apply appropriate relationship stage |

## Integration Notes

**Individual NPC documents can override these defaults** if justified and documented.

**First meeting:** Always apply stranger protocol unless relationship pre-established.

**Established relationships:** Use NPC document history, bypass stranger defaults.

**Zero tolerance violations:** Stranger acts as trusted friend, NPC has no motivation, wrong archetype for plot-critical NPC → must correct.
