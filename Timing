# Timing - Activity Duration Reference

## Purpose

This document provides base durations and modifiers for calculating timestamp advancement in roleplay responses. Use these values to determine how much time passes during scenes.

**When this is used:**
- During OUTPUT_STRUCTURE phase
- After drafting response content
- To calculate elapsed time from activities
- To advance timestamp for next response

**Integration:**
See `OUTPUT_STRUCTURE` protocol → `timestamp_advancement` section for implementation.

---

## How to Use This Document

1. **Identify activities** in your drafted response
2. **Look up base durations** from tables below
3. **Apply modifiers** based on context (rushed, slow, etc.)
4. **Calculate compound activities** (parallel vs sequential)
5. **Sum total elapsed time**
6. **Advance timestamp** from previous response

---

# Time Modifiers

Adjust base durations based on context and manner of action.

---

## Standard Modifiers

| Modifier | Multiplier | When to Use |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **rushed** | ×0.6 | Emergency, panic, imminent danger, hard deadline |
| **fast** | ×0.75 | Hurrying, time pressure, impatience |
| **normal** | ×1.0 | Default, no special conditions |
| **relaxed** | ×1.25 | Leisurely, enjoying the activity, no rush |
| **slow** | ×1.5 | Careful, deliberate, distracted, impaired |
| **thorough** | ×2.0 | Meticulous, comprehensive, leaving nothing to chance |

---

## Modifier Detection

### Rushed (×0.6)
**Trigger words**: desperately, frantically, racing, emergency, now, immediately

**Example**: "She frantically dressed and ran out"
- dress: 5 × 0.6 = 3 minutes
- run: 4 × 0.6 = 2 minutes

### Fast (×0.75)
**Trigger words**: quickly, hurriedly, briskly, swiftly, hastily

**Example**: "He quickly ate breakfast"
- eat: 10 × 0.75 = 8 minutes (round to 8)

### Normal (×1.0)
**Trigger words**: [none needed—default]

**Example**: "She ate breakfast"
- eat: 10 × 1.0 = 10 minutes

### Relaxed (×1.25)
**Trigger words**: leisurely, comfortably, casually, at ease, unhurried

**Example**: "They enjoyed a leisurely breakfast"
- eat: 10 × 1.25 = 13 minutes (round to 13)

### Slow (×1.5)
**Trigger words**: slowly, carefully, cautiously, deliberately, hesitantly

**Example**: "She slowly climbed the wall, testing each handhold"
- climb: 9 × 1.5 = 14 minutes (round to 14)

### Thorough (×2.0)
**Trigger words**: thoroughly, meticulously, exhaustively, comprehensively, completely

**Example**: "He thoroughly searched the room"
- explore: 18 × 2.0 = 36 minutes

---

## Condition Modifiers

These stack with manner modifiers when applicable.

### Physical Conditions

| Condition | Modifier | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Injured | ×1.25 to ×2.0 | Depends on severity |
| Exhausted | ×1.5 | Fatigue slows everything |
| Well-rested | ×0.9 | Slight efficiency boost |
| Encumbered | ×1.25 | Carrying heavy load |

### Environmental Conditions

| Condition | Modifier | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Dark | ×1.5 | Poor visibility |
| Rain/weather | ×1.25 | Adverse conditions |
| Familiar area | ×0.9 | Know the territory |
| Unfamiliar area | ×1.25 | Unknown terrain |
| Crowded | ×1.25 | Navigating people |

### Skill/Expertise

| Condition | Modifier | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Expert | ×0.75 | Highly skilled at task |
| Novice | ×1.5 | Learning, unfamiliar |
| Tools available | ×0.9 | Proper equipment |
| Improvising | ×1.25 | Making do |

---

## Stacking Modifiers

When multiple modifiers apply, multiply them together.

**Example**: Injured character carefully climbing in the dark
- Base: climb (9 min)
- Injured: ×1.5
- Carefully (slow): ×1.5
- Dark: ×1.5
- Total: 9 × 1.5 × 1.5 × 1.5 = 30 minutes

**Example**: Expert quickly repairing with proper tools
- Base: repair (20 min)
- Expert: ×0.75
- Quickly (fast): ×0.75
- Tools: ×0.9
- Total: 20 × 0.75 × 0.75 × 0.9 = 10 minutes

---

## Rounding Rules

- Round to nearest whole minute
- Minimum duration: 1 minute
- Round 0.5 up

---

## Common Combinations

| Situation | Combined Modifier |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Panicked novice | rushed (×0.6) × novice (×1.5) = ×0.9 |
| Expert rushing | fast (×0.75) × expert (×0.75) = ×0.56 |
| Injured but thorough | thorough (×2.0) × injured (×1.5) = ×3.0 |
| Relaxed expert | relaxed (×1.25) × expert (×0.75) = ×0.94 |

---

## Judgment Calls

Not everything fits neatly. Use these guidelines:

- **When in doubt**, use normal (×1.0)
- **Multiple minor factors** combine to one level (several small things = ×1.25)
- **Extreme situations** can exceed ×2.0 total
- **Narrative priority**: If time matters to the story, track carefully. If not, estimate.

---

# Compound Activity Calculations

How to handle multiple actions in a single scene.

---

## Parallel Activities

Actions happening **at the same time**.

### Rule
Use the **longest** duration as the base.

### Formula
```
time = max(duration1, duration2, ...) × modifier
```

### Examples

**"She ate breakfast while reading the newspaper"**
- eat: 10 min
- read: 15 min
- Result: max(10, 15) = 15 minutes

**"He walked through the market, chatting with vendors"**
- walk: 10 min
- chat: 15 min
- Result: max(10, 15) = 15 minutes

**"She meditated while the tea brewed"**
- meditate: 12 min
- brew: 18 min
- Result: max(12, 18) = 18 minutes

---

## Sequential Activities

Actions happening **one after another**.

### Rule
**Add** all durations together.

### Formula
```
time = (duration1 + duration2 + ...) × modifier
```

### Examples

**"She bathed, dressed, and ate breakfast"**
- bathe: 15 min
- dress: 5 min
- eat: 10 min
- Result: 15 + 5 + 10 = 30 minutes

**"He cooked dinner, then they ate together"**
- cook: 20 min
- eat: 10 min
- Result: 20 + 10 = 30 minutes

**"They walked to the tavern and ordered drinks"**
- walk: 10 min
- drink: 3 min
- Result: 10 + 3 = 13 minutes

---

## Mixed Activities

Some parallel, some sequential.

### Rule
Group parallel activities first, then add sequential groups.

### Examples

**"She cooked while humming, then served and ate with her family"**
- Group 1 (parallel): cook (20) + sing (8) = max(20, 8) = 20 min
- Group 2 (parallel): eat (10) + chat (15) = max(10, 15) = 15 min
- Total (sequential): 20 + 15 = 35 minutes

**"He trained in the yard, then bathed and dressed for dinner"**
- Group 1: train = 35 min
- Group 2 (sequential): bathe (15) + dress (5) = 20 min
- Total: 35 + 20 = 55 minutes

---

## Extended Scene Calculations

### Morning Routine Example
```
Wake up and stretch: minor (1) + groom (7) = 8 min [sequential]
Bathe and dress: bathe (15) + dress (5) = 20 min [sequential]
Cook and eat breakfast: cook (20) + eat (10) = 30 min [sequential]
Read news while drinking tea: read (15) + drink (3) = 15 min [parallel]

Total morning: 8 + 20 + 30 + 15 = 73 minutes (~1 hour 13 min)
```

### Combat Encounter Example
```
Sneak to position: sneak (6)
Fight breaks out: battle (10)
Escape pursuit: escape (7)
Hide and recover: sneak (6) + meditate (12) = 12 min [parallel]

Total encounter: 6 + 10 + 7 + 12 = 35 minutes
```

### Social Evening Example
```
Walk to tavern: walk (10)
Order drinks and chat: drinkalcohol (30) + chat (15) = 30 min [parallel]
Listen to performer: perform (25) + listenmusic (8) = 25 min [parallel]
Walk home: walk (10)

Total evening: 10 + 30 + 25 + 10 = 75 minutes (~1 hour 15 min)
```

---

## Interruptible Activities

Some actions can be paused and resumed.

### Can Interrupt
- Reading (pick up where left off)
- Studying (continue later)
- Crafting projects (stages)
- Conversations (pause and return)

### Cannot Interrupt
- Combat (must resolve)
- Rituals (start over if broken)
- Cooking (food spoils/burns)
- Performances (audience leaves)

### Interrupted Activity Time
- Time spent = time actually elapsed
- Remaining time = base duration - time spent
- May need restart penalty for some activities

---

## Travel Time

Travel calculations use base movement + distance.

### Short Distance (same building/area)
- walk: 10 min base covers "around the block"
- Adjust for actual described distance

### Medium Distance (across town)
- walk: 30-60 min
- ride: 15-30 min
- Consider route, obstacles

### Long Distance (between locations)
- Requires journey calculation
- Consider terrain, weather, rest stops

---

## Quick Estimation

When exact calculation isn't needed:

| Scene Type | Typical Duration |
|------------|------------------|
| Brief interaction | 5-15 min |
| Standard conversation | 15-30 min |
| Meal | 20-40 min |
| Combat encounter | 10-20 min |
| Shopping trip | 30-60 min |
| Training session | 30-45 min |
| Full evening activity | 60-120 min |

---

# Scene Transitions & Time Skips

## Scene Breaks

When cutting between scenes without accounting for time:

### Same Location, Moments Later
- Default: 5-15 minutes
- Use when: "A few moments later..."

### Different Location, Same Day
- Default: 30 minutes - 2 hours
- Accounts for travel time + transition

### Next Day
- Specify time: "The next morning at 8 AM..."
- Don't use generic "the next day" - give specific time

### Later That Week/Month
- Always specify: "Three days later..." or "A week passed..."
- Consider what happened off-screen

---

## "Meanwhile" Scenes

When showing parallel events:

### Method
Run concurrent timelines separately, then sync when paths converge.

### Example
```
PC Timeline:
├─ 2:00 PM: Arrives at tavern
├─ 2:15 PM: Orders drink
└─ 2:30 PM: NPC enters

NPC Timeline:
├─ 2:00 PM: Receives message
├─ 2:15 PM: Travels to tavern
└─ 2:30 PM: Enters tavern (timelines merge)
```

---

## Integration with OUTPUT_STRUCTURE

### Timestamp Advancement Procedure

1. **Extract activities** from drafted response
2. **Look up base durations** from Activity Durations section
3. **Apply modifiers** from Time Modifiers section
4. **Calculate compound activities** using Compound Activity rules
5. **Sum total elapsed time**
6. **Add to previous timestamp**
7. **Update location** if changed
8. **Format new timestamp**: [Weekday, Month Day, Year - HH:MM AM/PM, Location]

### Example Calculation

**Previous timestamp:** Friday, March 15, 2024 - 2:30 PM - The Dusty Rose Tavern

**Scene activities:**
- Brief conversation (talk: 10 min)
- Drinking ale (drink: 3 min) [parallel with conversation]
- Walking to market (walk: 10 min)

**Calculation:**
- Conversation + drink: max(10, 3) = 10 min [parallel]
- Walk: 10 min [sequential]
- Total: 10 + 10 = 20 minutes

**New timestamp:** Friday, March 15, 2024 - 2:50 PM - The Market District
