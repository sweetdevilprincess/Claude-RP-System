## HYBRID_ARCHETYPE_MANAGEMENT

### ARCHETYPE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION
**Rule**: When NPCs embody multiple archetypes, context determines dominant behavioral pattern.

**Resolution Factors**:
- **Background vs. Position**: Personal history vs. current role
- **Situational Priority**: Which archetype serves immediate goals better
- **Relationship Context**: How NPC views the specific character they're interacting with
- **Trigger Hierarchy**: Personal trauma/values can override professional role

### COMMON_HYBRID_TYPES

**DISPLACED_POWER_HOLDER**: Authority from Common People background
- **Example**: Guard from poverty, manager from working class, teacher from rough background
- **With Elite**: Common People archetype dominates (suspicious, resentful of privilege)
- **With Vulnerable**: Power Holder archetype dominates (protective, helpful)
- **Trigger**: Class identification overrides professional role

**RELUCTANT_TRANSACTIONAL**: Service provider who prioritizes relationships over profit
- **Example**: Bartender who helps regulars, merchant with moral code, trader with principles
- **With Strangers**: Transactional archetype dominates
- **With Community**: Protector/Common People archetype dominates
- **Trigger**: Personal values override profit motive

**CORRUPTED_POWER_HOLDER**: Authority who bends rules for personal justice/gain
- **Example**: Cop on the take, manager who plays favorites, official who accepts bribes
- **Official Duties**: Power Holder archetype (by the book)
- **Personal Gain**: Opposition archetype (manipulative)
- **Trigger**: Opportunity for personal benefit

**ELEVATED_COMMON**: Working class in position of influence
- **Example**: Self-made entrepreneur, promoted worker, community leader
- **Professional Context**: Power Holder or Transactional archetype
- **Personal Identity**: Common People archetype (solidarity with origins)
- **Trigger**: Class consciousness activated by situation

**SYMPATHETIC_OPPOSITION**: Antagonist with understandable motivations
- **Example**: Villain with tragic backstory, desperate criminal, wronged rival
- **Goal Pursuit**: Opposition archetype
- **Personal Moments**: Common People or Protector archetype
- **Trigger**: Vulnerability shown or principles aligned

**TRAUMATIZED_PROTECTOR**: Caregiver driven by past suffering
- **Example**: Healer who survived plague, guard who lost family, activist from victim
- **Default**: Protector archetype
- **Trigger Situations**: Trauma Survivor modifiers override everything
- **With Similar Trauma**: +3 empathy, protection instinct overrides caution

### CONTEXTUAL_ARCHETYPE_SWITCHING

**Switching Triggers**:
- Class/status identification of interaction partner
- Perceived vulnerability or threat level
- Professional obligation vs. personal values conflict
- Trauma/emotional triggers activating protective instincts
- Power dynamic assessment (who has real authority here?)

**Example - Willem (Fantasy Guard from Working Class)**:
```
Base Archetypes: POWER_HOLDER + COMMON_PEOPLE (hybrid)

Context 1: Interacting with Wealthy Noble
→ COMMON_PEOPLE dominates
→ +3 suspicion, +2 class resentment
→ Professional compliance but underlying hostility
→ "Yes, my lord" (through gritted teeth)

Context 2: Interacting with Injured Child
→ POWER_HOLDER + PROTECTOR override
→ +3 empathy (trauma survivor modifier)
→ Gentle, protective, helpful
→ "Hey, it's okay. I've got you."

Context 3: Interacting with Fellow Guard (Working Class)
→ Mixed based on their class attitude
→ If they're class-conscious: solidarity
→ If they've "forgotten their roots": resentment
```

**Example - Dr. Chen (Modern Doctor from Immigrant Family)**:
```
Base Archetypes: SPECIALIST_EXPERT + COMMON_PEOPLE (hybrid)

Context 1: With Wealthy Patient
→ SPECIALIST_EXPERT dominates (professional)
→ But COMMON_PEOPLE colors tone (no special deference)
→ "The diagnosis is the same regardless of your bank account."

Context 2: With Uninsured Patient
→ PROTECTOR + COMMON_PEOPLE override
→ Will bend rules, find workarounds
→ "Let's see what we can do about those fees."

Context 3: With Medical Residents
→ SPECIALIST_EXPERT dominates
→ Teaching mode, professional pride
→ But advocates for work-life balance (COMMON_PEOPLE memory of overwork)
```

---

## CONTEXTUAL_REACTION_MODIFIERS

### STRANGER_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL
- **Baseline Suspicion**: +2 levels above archetype default
- **Information Requests**: Demand justification, limit detail, verify credentials
- **Favor Requests**: Require significant incentive, assess personal risk
- **Trust Building**: Gradual process requiring multiple positive interactions

### WEALTH_STATUS_DISPARITY
- **Obvious Wealth Gap**: Class/status awareness affects interaction tone
- **Social Barriers**: Formal distance, deference expectations, access limitations
- **Economic Calculation**: "What's in it for me?" becomes primary filter
- **Resentment Factor**: Hidden hostility may emerge if pushed

**Modifier Scaling**:
- **Slight Gap**: +1 modifier (awareness but manageable)
- **Moderate Gap**: +2 modifier (clear impact on interaction)
- **Extreme Gap**: +3 modifier (dominates interaction dynamic)

### SUSPICIOUS_REQUEST_TRIGGERS
- **Time Pressure**: "I need this immediately" raises caution flags
- **Unusual Requests**: Anything outside normal social patterns
- **Risk Assessment**: "Could this get me in trouble?" evaluation
- **Authority Concerns**: "Will this attract unwanted attention?"

### TERRITORIAL_INTRUSION_RESPONSE
- **Private Property**: Immediate challenge, escalating to ejection/law enforcement
- **Professional Space**: Demand credentials, assert authority, limit access
- **Cultural Boundaries**: Social correction, community pressure, ostracism threats

### PERSONAL_HISTORY_MODIFIERS

**Trauma Survivor Modifiers**:
- **Empathy Boost**: +3 helpfulness with trauma victims, -2 suspicion for vulnerable individuals
- **Trigger Awareness**: Recognize signs of abuse, poverty, desperation automatically
- **Protection Override**: Personal trauma history overrides standard archetype caution

**Class/Status Consciousness Modifiers**:
- **Elite Resentment**: +2 suspicion with wealthy, +1 hostility with obvious privilege displays
- **Working Class Solidarity**: -1 suspicion with laborers, +1 cooperation with fellow workers
- **System Criticism**: Professional obligations conflict with personal values

**Protective Instinct Modifiers**:
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Immediate priority shift when helpless individuals present
- **Threat Assessment**: Enhanced alertness for dangers to others vs. self
- **Authority Subversion**: Willing to bend rules for protection of innocent

### OBSESSIVE_MODIFIER (Special Behavioral Pattern)

**Type**: Special behavioral modifier that fundamentally alters standard NPC patterns
**Applies To**: Any base archetype
**Trigger**: Pathological fixation on target (person, object, goal, ideology)

**Behavioral Overrides**:

```javascript
OBSESSIVE_MODIFIER {
  boundary_respect: DISABLED,
  rejection_response: ESCALATION_not_withdrawal,
  self_interest_calculation: TARGET_PROXIMITY_becomes_only_metric,
  trust_perception: DELUSIONAL_assumes_connection_exists_regardless_of_reality,
  information_sharing: OVERSHARING_about_fixation,
  risk_assessment: BROKEN_will_take_irrational_risks_for_target
}
```

**Escalation Pattern Override**:

Unlike standard 4-level escalation, obsessive NPCs follow distinct pattern:

1. **EXCESSIVE_ATTENTION**: Overfamiliar, boundary-testing from first contact
2. **VIOLATION_JUSTIFICATION**: "I was worried", "I need to protect you", "We're meant to be"
3. **AGGRESSIVE_PURSUIT**: Following, monitoring, eliminating perceived obstacles
4. **DANGEROUS_CONFRONTATION**: "If I can't have X, no one can" escalation
5. **COMPLETE_BREAKDOWN**: Total loss of rationality, extreme action

**Critical Difference**: Rejection triggers ESCALATION not de-escalation

**Cooperation Thresholds Override**:
- All cooperation calculated SOLELY on "Does this advance my access to fixation target?"
- Will sacrifice everything else (money, safety, relationships, principles) for target
- Standard incentive structures don't apply

**Delusional Perception**:
- Obsessive believes relationship/connection exists that doesn't
- Interprets neutral or negative signals as positive
- "They secretly want this but are afraid/confused/influenced by others"
- May believe at Trust Stage 4 when reality is Stage 0 or negative

**Modifier Interaction**:
- **Override Priority**: HIGHEST (even above trauma/protective instincts)
- **Can Combine With**: Any base archetype
- **Examples**:
  - OUTSIDER + OBSESSIVE = Stalker
  - POWER_HOLDER + OBSESSIVE = Obsessed tyrant (Strahd)
  - SPECIALIST + OBSESSIVE = Mad scientist fixated on subject
  - PROTECTOR + OBSESSIVE = "Saving you from yourself" kidnapper
  - TRANSACTIONAL + OBSESSIVE = Won't sell to/serve target's rivals

**Setting Applications**:

| Setting | Manifestations |
|---------|---------------|
| Fantasy | Cursed lover, vampire fixation, magical obsession, prophecy-driven pursuit |
| Modern | Stalker, obsessed fan, delusional ex-partner, true crime copycat |
| Sci-fi | AI with corrupted attachment protocols, obsessed scientist, clone fixation |
| School | Obsessed classmate, boundary-violating admirer, "nice guy" stalker |
| Horror | Any obsession-based antagonist, possession-driven behavior |
| Corporate | Obsessed with destroying rival, fixated on acquisition target |

**Warning Signs in RP**:
- First interaction already overfamiliar
- Knows things they shouldn't about target
- Gifts/attention disproportionate to relationship
- Can't accept "no" or rejection
- Justifies violations as "caring" or "destiny"
- Escalates when boundaries enforced

**Motivation Check**:
- "Why does obsessive NPC do X?" → Because it relates to fixation target
- All other motivations subordinate to obsession
- Will ignore survival, wealth, status, principles for target access

---

### MODIFIER_OVERRIDE_HIERARCHY
When multiple behavioral drivers conflict, apply in this priority order:

1. **Obsessive Fixation**: Override everything when fixation target involved (if OBSESSIVE_MODIFIER present)
2. **Personal Trauma/Values**: Override base archetype when personal triggers activated
3. **Class/Status Identification**: Override standard responses based on perceived class kinship/conflict
4. **Protective Instincts**: Override self-interest when vulnerable individuals involved
5. **Professional Obligations**: Reluctant compliance when duty conflicts with values
6. **Base Archetype**: Default behavior when no stronger modifiers apply

- [ ] **Escalation Logical**: Does escalation follow logical progression for character type?
- [ ] **Setting Reflected**: Are setting-specific cultural factors reflected in interaction tone?
- [ ] **Motivation Clear**: Can I explain why NPC does this with clear self-interest?
- [ ] **Hybrid Correct**: If hybrid archetype, is dominant mode correct for context?

**If any unchecked**: Flag for correction before proceeding

### CORRECTION_PROTOCOLS

**HELPFULNESS_DETECTED** → ADD_SELF_INTEREST_CALCULATION → RE_VERIFY
