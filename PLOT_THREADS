# PLOT_THREADS.md

## Purpose

This document defines **plot-critical threads** that require active monitoring to prevent loss. These threads get response counters and graduated intervention if not progressed naturally.

**Note:** Not all story threads need monitoring. Only add threads here that are:
- Critical to main plot progression
- Time-sensitive with real consequences
- Important character arcs that shouldn't be dropped

Most threads rely purely on semantic triggers and don't need monitoring.

## Active Plot-Critical Threads

### murder_investigation

**Monitoring Configuration:**
```javascript
{
  status: "active",
  priority: "high",
  monitor: true,
  threshold: 5,  // Flag for consideration at 5 responses without progression
  
  intervention_levels: {
    5_responses: "gentle_consideration",
    10_responses: "create_opportunity", 
    15_responses: "manifest_consequence"
  }
}
```

**Related Documents:**
- Chapter_3_Murder_Discovery
- Chapter_7_Investigation_Begins
- Chapter_12_Palace_Connection
- NPC_Detective_Marcus

**Semantic Triggers:**
(These trigger docs even without counter - see TRIGGER_INDEX.md)
- Keywords: "investigation", "murder", "Marcus", "case", "evidence", "body", "detective"
- Themes: crime investigation, conspiracy, palace intrigue

**Surfacing Methods:**
When counter flags this thread, reintroduce organically through:
1. **NPC Action:** Marcus seeks player with breakthrough/lead
2. **World Event:** New evidence discovered, witness comes forward
3. **Environmental:** Player passes crime scene, sees guards investigating
4. **Consequence:** Investigation progresses without player, arrest happens
5. **Time Pressure:** Trial date approaches, deadline mentioned

**Time Pressure:**
- Deadline: Trial in 7 days (in-game time)
- Consequence if ignored: Trial proceeds without player input, wrong person convicted, Marcus disappointed

**Counter Reset Conditions:**
- Player mentions investigation
- Player interacts with Marcus
- Player discovers evidence
- Investigation progresses in any way
- Player explicitly engages with thread

### romance_Willem

**Monitoring Configuration:**
```javascript
{
  status: "active",
  priority: "medium",
  monitor: true,
  threshold: 7,  // Less urgent than investigation, longer before intervention
  
  intervention_levels: {
    7_responses: "gentle_consideration",
    12_responses: "create_opportunity",
    18_responses: "manifest_consequence"
  }
}
```

**Related Documents:**
- Chapter_1_First_Meeting
- Chapter_4_Tension_Builds
- Chapter_6_Interrupted_Kiss
- Chapter_9_Confession
- NPC_Willem

**Semantic Triggers:**
- Keywords: "Willem", "romance", "feelings", "kiss", "relationship", "guard captain"
- Themes: romantic tension, vulnerability, trust

**Surfacing Methods:**
1. **NPC Action:** Willem appears at player's location, initiates conversation
2. **Third Party:** Another NPC asks about Willem, mentions seeing him
3. **Environmental:** Player visits location associated with Willem (their spot)
4. **Consequence:** Willem's distance/hurt becomes visible, relationship regresses
5. **Memory:** Sensory reminder of shared moment (his scent, a sound, etc.)

**Time Pressure:**
- No hard deadline, but emotional consequences
- Consequence if ignored: Willem interprets silence as rejection, pulls away emotionally, becomes harder to reach

**Counter Reset Conditions:**
- Player mentions Willem
- Player seeks Willem out
- Willem appears in scene and interaction occurs
- Romance develops or regresses in any way
- Player acknowledges feelings/relationship

### prophecy_revelation

**Monitoring Configuration:**
```javascript
{
  status: "active",
  priority: "low",
  monitor: true,
  threshold: 10,  // Background arc, can simmer longer
  
  intervention_levels: {
    10_responses: "gentle_consideration",
    15_responses: "create_opportunity",
    20_responses: "manifest_consequence"
  }
}
```

**Related Documents:**

**Semantic Triggers:**
- Keywords: "prophecy", "vision", "signs", "fate", "Sybil", "magic", "destiny"
- Themes: magical portents, destiny, ancient warnings

**Surfacing Methods:**
1. **Vision/Dream:** Player experiences prophetic dream or waking vision
2. **Environmental:** Prophetic signs manifest (weather, omens, symbolism)
3. **NPC Action:** Sybil seeks player, sends cryptic message
4. **World Event:** Prophecy elements begin manifesting in world
5. **Consequence:** Prophecy progresses toward fulfillment with or without player

**Time Pressure:**
- Prophecy unfolds on its own timeline
- Consequence if ignored: Events prophesied begin occurring, player unprepared

**Counter Reset Conditions:**
- Player discusses prophecy
- Player experiences prophetic event
- Player seeks Sybil or magical guidance
- Signs manifest and player notices/reacts
- Prophecy thread develops

## Adding New Threads

When adding a plot-critical thread:

1. **Confirm it needs monitoring:** Will the story break if this is forgotten?
2. **Set appropriate priority:** High/Medium/Low based on urgency
3. **Define surfacing methods:** How can this organically reappear?
4. **List related docs:** What should load when surfacing this?
5. **Establish reset conditions:** What counts as "progressing" this thread?

**Default to NOT monitoring** - most threads work fine with semantic triggers alone.

---

## Removing Threads

Remove threads from monitoring when:
- Thread resolved/completed
- Player explicitly abandoned thread (their choice)
- Thread no longer plot-critical
- Consequences manifested, thread naturally concluded

Move to "Inactive/Resolved Threads" section for reference.

## Usage Notes

**For Claude:**
- Check this document during PRE-PLANNING phase
- Compare current counters against thresholds
- Consult surfacing methods when counter flags thread
- Load related docs when creating organic opening
- Update status as threads resolve

**For User:**
- Add threads as plot develops
- Remove threads when resolved
- Adjust thresholds based on pacing needs
- Update surfacing methods as story evolves
- Mark threads inactive when appropriate
