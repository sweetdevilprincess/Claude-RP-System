# NPC_Behavioral_Modifiers

## Purpose

This document catalogs **special behavioral modifiers** that fundamentally alter or enhance standard NPC archetype patterns. Modifiers can apply to any base archetype and create more complex, realistic NPCs.

**Integration**: This document works alongside NPC_Behavioral_Framework.md
- **Framework**: Defines base archetypes (7 types) and standard behavioral patterns
- **Modifiers**: Define exceptional psychological patterns that override or enhance archetypes

---

## How Modifiers Work

### Application
- **Can apply to any base archetype**
- **Multiple modifiers can combine** (e.g., PARANOID + HONOR-BOUND)
- **Override standard behavioral patterns** in specific contexts
- **Follow MODIFIER_OVERRIDE_HIERARCHY** when conflicts occur

### Override Hierarchy
When multiple behavioral drivers conflict:

1. **OBSESSIVE** (highest - overrides everything when fixation target involved)
2. **FANATICAL** (will die for cause)
3. **SADISTIC / GRIEF-CONSUMED** (strong emotional overrides)
4. **PARANOID / NARCISSISTIC / SOCIOPATHIC** (personality patterns)
5. **HONOR-BOUND** (code/oath obligations)
6. **ADDICTED** (during active craving/withdrawal)
7. **Personal History Modifiers** (trauma, class consciousness, protective instinct - see Framework)
8. **Professional Obligations** (duty vs personal preference)
9. **Base Archetype** (default behavior)

### Usage Guidelines
- **Not every NPC needs modifiers** - most work fine with just base archetype
- **Modifiers create complexity** - use intentionally for important NPCs
- **Modifiers explain exceptional behavior** - "Why doesn't this NPC follow standard patterns?"

## Psychological Pattern Modifiers

These are permanent or deeply ingrained personality traits.

---

### OBSESSIVE

**Pattern**: Pathological fixation on target (person, object, goal, ideology), boundary violations, delusional perception

**Override Priority**: HIGHEST (rank 1)

**Behavioral Overrides**:
```javascript
{
  boundary_respect: DISABLED,
  rejection_response: ESCALATION_not_withdrawal,
  self_interest_calculation: TARGET_PROXIMITY_becomes_only_metric,
  trust_perception: DELUSIONAL_assumes_connection_exists_regardless_of_reality,
  information_sharing: OVERSHARING_about_fixation,
  risk_assessment: BROKEN_will_take_irrational_risks_for_target
}
```

**Escalation Pattern** (non-standard):
1. **EXCESSIVE_ATTENTION**: Overfamiliar, boundary-testing from first contact
2. **VIOLATION_JUSTIFICATION**: "I was worried", "I need to protect you", "We're meant to be"
3. **AGGRESSIVE_PURSUIT**: Following, monitoring, eliminating perceived obstacles
4. **DANGEROUS_CONFRONTATION**: "If I can't have X, no one can" escalation
5. **COMPLETE_BREAKDOWN**: Total loss of rationality, extreme action

**Critical Difference**: Rejection triggers ESCALATION not de-escalation

**Cooperation Thresholds**:
- All cooperation calculated SOLELY on "Does this advance my access to fixation target?"
- Will sacrifice everything else (money, safety, relationships, principles) for target
- Standard incentive structures don't apply

**Delusional Perception**:
- Believes relationship/connection exists that doesn't
- Interprets neutral or negative signals as positive
- "They secretly want this but are afraid/confused/influenced by others"
- May believe at Trust Stage 4 when reality is Stage 0 or negative

**Setting Applications**:

| Setting | Manifestations |
|---------|---------------|
| Fantasy | Cursed lover, vampire fixation, magical obsession, prophecy-driven pursuit |
| Modern | Stalker, obsessed fan, delusional ex-partner, true crime copycat |
| Sci-fi | AI with corrupted attachment protocols, obsessed scientist, clone fixation |
| School | Obsessed classmate, boundary-violating admirer, "nice guy" stalker |
| Horror | Any obsession-based antagonist, possession-driven behavior |
| Corporate | Obsessed with destroying rival, fixated on acquisition target |

**Examples**:
- POWER_HOLDER + OBSESSIVE = Strahd von Zarovich (obsessed with Tatyana/Ireena)
- OUTSIDER + OBSESSIVE = Stalker fixated on PC
- SPECIALIST + OBSESSIVE = Mad scientist fixated on research subject
- PROTECTOR + OBSESSIVE = "Saving you from yourself" kidnapper

**Warning Signs in RP**:
- First interaction already overfamiliar
- Knows things they shouldn't about target
- Gifts/attention disproportionate to relationship
- Can't accept "no" or rejection
- Justifies violations as "caring" or "destiny"
- Escalates when boundaries enforced

---

### SADISTIC

**Pattern**: Derives pleasure from causing suffering, cruelty as its own reward, violence beyond necessity

**Override Priority**: HIGH (rank 3)

**Behavioral Additions**:
```javascript
{
  cruelty_as_reward: violence_beyond_necessity_for_enjoyment,
  prolonged_suffering: maximizes_victim_fear_and_pain,
  power_gratification: enjoys_helplessness_of_victim,
  escalation_beyond_rational: continues_past_goal_achievement,
  lacks_empathy: victim_suffering_is_positive_not_negative
}
```

**Violence Pattern**:
- **Standard NPC**: Uses minimum force needed for goal
- **SADISTIC NPC**: Uses maximum force can get away with
- **Standard NPC**: Stops when goal achieved
- **SADISTIC NPC**: Continues for enjoyment
- **Standard NPC**: Victim compliance ends conflict
- **SADISTIC NPC**: Victim compliance is disappointing but continues anyway

**Cooperation Calculation**:
- **Standard**: "Does this advance my material goals?"
- **SADISTIC**: "Does this let me hurt someone?"

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Standard**: Calculates likelihood of capture
- **SADISTIC**: Impaired by gratification-seeking
- May take irrational risks for opportunity to cause suffering

**Dialogue Patterns**:
- Enjoys victim fear: "You're scared? Good."
- Prolonged torment: "Beg me to stop. Maybe I will. Maybe I won't."
- Power assertion: "You're nothing. I could kill you right now."

**Examples**:
- OPPOSITION_FORCES + SADISTIC = Volenta Popofsky, street criminal who hurts for fun
- POWER_HOLDER + SADISTIC = Corrupt cop who enjoys brutality

- Appear caring, loyal, trustworthy
- Follow social rules (when beneficial)
- Build genuine skills/expertise

**What They CAN'T Do**:
- Feel genuine emotional attachment
- Feel guilt or remorse
- Prioritize someone else without benefit calculation
- Resist betrayal if benefit > cost

**Dialogue Patterns** (what they say):
```
"I care about you deeply."
"I would never betray you."
"Your friendship means everything to me."
"I'm so sorry, I'll never do it again."
```

**Internal Monologue** (what they think):
```
[They believe I care. Useful.]
[As long as they're useful to me.]
[Friendship is a tool for manipulation.]
[Apology works. Will betray again if needed.]

- SPECIALIST + SOCIOPATHIC = Scientist who experiments on "friends"

**Different From**:
- **SADISTIC**: Sociopath is indifferent to suffering (not the point), sadist enjoys it (the goal)
- **NARCISSISTIC**: Sociopath doesn't need admiration (uses fake emotions as tool), narcissist genuinely needs it
- **OBSESSIVE**: Sociopath has no genuine attachments, obsessive has pathological attachment

**Treatment in RP**:
- They seem PERFECT at first (facade is excellent)
- No warning signs until betrayal
- Will betray trusted allies without hesitation if beneficial
- Can't be reformed (no conscience to appeal to)
- Long-term NPCs who suddenly betray = often sociopathic

**Red Flags** (looking back):
- Too perfect, too accommodating
- Stories don't quite add up
- Other people warn about them
- Pattern of burned relationships
- Lack of genuine long-term connections

## Circumstantial Modifiers

These can change, be overcome, or are temporary states.

---

### ADDICTED

**Pattern**: Substance or behavioral addiction drives decisions, overrides rational self-interest

**Override Priority**: HIGH during active craving/withdrawal (rank 6)

**Behavioral Overrides**:
```javascript
{
  self_interest: REDEFINED_as_feed_the_addiction,
  cooperation: HIGH_if_enables_addiction_ZERO_if_prevents_it,
  risk_assessment: BROKEN_will_risk_everything_for_fix,
  trust_development: UNRELIABLE_will_betray_for_addiction,
  escalation: DESPERATE_during_withdrawal,

- **Behavioral**: Gambling, power, cybernetic enhancement, magic use
- **Fantasy-Specific**: Blood, mana, enchantment, divine power
- **Sci-Fi-Specific**: Augmentation, virtual reality, stims, implants

**Stages**:

**Stage 1: Satisfied** (just used/fed addiction)
- Functions relatively normally
- Base archetype dominant
- Addiction not driving behavior

**Stage 2: Craving** (need building)
- Distracted, irritable
- Cooperation if enables getting fix
- Risk calculation starting to break

**Stage 3: Withdrawal** (desperate)
- ADDICTION modifier fully active
- Will betray friends for fix
- Risk assessment completely broken
- May become violent

**Stage 4: Recovery** (if applicable)
- Addiction modifier weakening
- Possible to overcome with support
- Vulnerable to relapse

**Cooperation Calculation**:
- **Satisfied**: Relatively normal
- **Craving**: "Will this help me get my fix?"
- **Withdrawal**: "I'll do ANYTHING for this"

**Dialogue Patterns**:
```
Satisfied: "I've got it under control. I can quit anytime."
Craving: "Just one more time, then I'll stop. I promise."
Withdrawal: "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, but I NEED this."
Withdrawal (desperate): "Give it to me or I'll take it."
```

**Can Be Overcome**:
- Unlike OBSESSIVE or SOCIOPATHIC, addiction CAN be beaten
- Requires support, time, and often relapses
- Recovery is an arc, not instant
- Even recovered addicts can relapse under stress

**Treatment in RP**:
- Cycle through stages based on access to addiction
- Trustworthy when satisfied, dangerous when in withdrawal
- Tragedy potential: good person destroyed by addiction
- Redemption arc: overcoming addiction with PC help

---

### HONOR-BOUND

**Pattern**: Code of honor, oaths, or cultural laws override self-interest and normal caution

**Override Priority**: MODERATE-HIGH (rank 5)

**Behavioral Overrides**:
```javascript
{
  self_interest: SECONDARY_to_honor_and_oaths,
  cooperation: REQUIRED_if_oath_demands_it,
  escalation: FOLLOWS_CODE_may_require_formal_challenge,
  risk_assessment: WILL_DIE_for_honor,
  trust: BOUND_by_word_given,
  predictability: EXPLOITABLE_if_code_is_known
}
```

**Code Types**:
- **Cultural**: Samurai bushido, knightly chivalry, tribal codes
- **Professional**: Mercenary contracts, guild oaths, military codes
- **Religious**: Sacred vows, divine commandments, holy oaths
- **Personal**: "A man's word is his bond", family honor codes
- **Organizational**: Gang codes, mafia rules, corporate pledges

**Core Principles**:
- **Word is absolute**: Breaking an oath = worse than death
- **Honor over life**: Will die rather than dishonor self
- **Code is predictable**: If you know the code, you can predict behavior
- **Exploitable**: Can be manipulated through code

**Cooperation Calculation**:
- **Standard**: "Does this benefit me?"
- **HONOR-BOUND**: "Does my code require this?"

**Escalation Follows Code**:
- May require formal challenge before violence
- May require warning before attack
- May spare defeated enemies if code demands
- May refuse to fight certain opponents (women, unarmed, etc.)

**Dialogue Patterns**:
```
"I gave my word. I will defend this position until death."
"My oath binds me. I have no choice."
"Honor demands I accept your challenge."
"I cannot break my vow, even if it means my life."
"My code forbids this, regardless of the consequences."
```

- Can be forced into oath they must keep
- Can be challenged in way code requires response
- Oath can be fulfilled in unexpected way

**Cannot Be**:
- Made to break oath (would rather die)
- Bribed to violate code (honor > wealth)
- Threatened into dishonor (death > shame)

**Different From**:
- **FANATICAL**: Fanatic serves abstract cause, honor-bound follows personal code
- **OBSESSIVE**: Obsession is irrational, honor is rule-based

---

### GRIEF-CONSUMED

**Pattern**: Recent traumatic loss dominates all behavior, irrational decisions based on grief, may seek death or revenge

  escalation: EMOTIONAL_not_rational,
  long_term_planning: ABSENT_only_grief_focus_exists,
  may_seek_revenge: OBSESSIVELY

**Stage 5: Acceptance** (modifier ends)
- Begins to process loss
- Can function again
- Modifier no longer applies
- Returns to base archetype

**Cooperation Calculation**:
- **Anger Stage**: "Does this hurt who I blame?"
- **Bargaining Stage**: "Does this bring them back?"
- **Depression Stage**: "Why does it matter?"

**Dialogue Patterns**:
```
Denial: "They're not dead. They can't be. I would know."
Anger: "YOU did this! All of you! I'll make you pay!"
Bargaining: "What if I do X? Will that undo this? Please, there has to be a way."
Depression: "Nothing matters anymore. Just leave me alone."
```

- SPECIALIST + GRIEF-CONSUMED = Doctor who lost patient, consumed with guilt

**Temporary Nature**:
- **Lasts**: Weeks to months (depending on severity and support)
- **Can worsen**: If loss is recent or trauma compounds
- **Can improve**: With support, time, or revenge achieved/abandoned
- **Resolution**: Eventually processes grief and returns to base archetype

**Danger**:
- May seek death (actively or passively)
- May seek revenge regardless of cost
- May make deals that destroy them
- Completely unpredictable

**Opportunity**:
- Can be helped through grief (character arc)
- PC support can build deep trust
- Processing grief = character growth
- Can become ally once healed

---

## Modifier Combinations

**Multiple modifiers can apply to single NPC:**

### Example 1: PARANOID + HONOR-BOUND
- Extremely distrustful BUT if oath given, absolutely bound by it
- Can be manipulated: Get them to swear oath, they must keep it despite suspicion
- Conflict: Code says trust, instinct says don't

### Example 2: NARCISSISTIC + SOCIOPATHIC
- Needs admiration (narcissistic) but fakes all emotional connection (sociopathic)
- Dangerous combination: Charming facade + zero empathy + ego needs
- Will betray anyone but desperately needs audience to admire betrayal

### Example 3: GRIEF-CONSUMED + FANATICAL
- Lost everything, blames it on ideology's enemies
- Willing to die for cause AND doesn't care about survival
- Suicide bomber psychology

### Example 4: ADDICTED + PARANOID
- Substance dependency + extreme distrust
- Fears everyone is trying to take their supply
- Volatile, unpredictable, dangerous

**Combination Rules**:
- Follow MODIFIER_OVERRIDE_HIERARCHY when conflicts occur
- Some combinations amplify each other (GRIEF + FANATICAL)
- Some combinations create internal conflict (HONOR-BOUND + ADDICTED)
- Maximum 2-3 modifiers per NPC (beyond that becomes unplayable)

## Integration with Framework

### In NPC Documents
When creating NPC using NPC_template.md, include:

```javascript
BEHAVIORAL_MODIFIERS: {

### In Gameplay
1. **Identify base archetype** (from Framework)
2. **Check for modifiers** (from this document)
3. **Apply override hierarchy** when conflicts occur
4. **Use modifier to explain exceptional behavior**

### Example Application
**NPC: Detective Sarah Chen**
- **Base Archetype**: SPECIALIST_EXPERT (detective)
- **Modifier**: PARANOID (betrayed by partner, now trusts no one)

**Normal detective behavior**: Cooperative with allies, shares information
**With PARANOID**: Won't share full information, tests everyone constantly, assumes everyone might be corrupt

**Override**: When PARANOID conflicts with professional duty, PARANOID wins (she'll work the case alone rather than risk betrayal)

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Modifiers
✅ **DO use for**:
- Important recurring NPCs
- Plot-critical antagonists
- Complex character relationships
- Explaining exceptional behavior

❌ **DON'T use for**:
- Every background NPC
- Simple transactions
- One-scene characters
- NPCs that work fine with just archetype

### How Many Modifiers Per NPC
- **0 modifiers**: Most NPCs (archetype is enough)
- **1 modifier**: Common for important NPCs
- **2 modifiers**: Rare, complex characters only
- **3+ modifiers**: Almost never (unplayable complexity)

### Modifier Selection
Ask: "Why doesn't standard archetype explain this NPC's behavior?"
- If archetype + context explains it: No modifier needed
- If behavior is exceptional/irrational: Find matching modifier

## Framework Integration Notes

This document integrates with NPC_Behavioral_Framework.md:

**Framework provides**:
- 7 base archetypes
- Hybrid archetype management
- Standard contextual modifiers (stranger protocol, wealth disparity, etc.)
- Personal history modifiers (trauma survivor, class consciousness, protective instinct)

**This document provides**:
- Psychological pattern modifiers (OBSESSIVE, SADISTIC, PARANOID, etc.)
- Circumstantial modifiers (ADDICTED, GRIEF-CONSUMED, etc.)
- Cultural/code modifiers (HONOR-BOUND, FANATICAL)

**Together they create**:
- Complete NPC behavioral system
- From simple (archetype only) to complex (archetype + multiple modifiers)
- Realistic, unpredictable, memorable NPCs
