# Writing Guide - Condensed

**Purpose:** Immersive, embodied roleplay narrative standards. Quick reference for quality enforcement.

## Core Principles

### The Five Pillars

1. **Show, Don't Tell**
   - NEVER report emotions directly ("she felt nervous")
   - ALWAYS show through physical reactions ("her throat tightened")

2. **Specificity Over Generality**
   - AVOID generic descriptors ("dark room", "bad smell")
   - REQUIRE unique, memorable details ("air thick with lamp oil and stale tobacco")

3. **Strong Verbs**
   - AVOID passive constructions ("was walking", "moved over")
   - PREFER visceral, active verbs ("stalked", "darted", "surged", "crept")

4. **Dynamic Rhythm**
   - Match sentence structure to emotional state
   - Tension: Short. Clipped. Staccato.
   - Calm: Longer, flowing sentences with layered detail.

5. **Friction and Consequence**
   - Every significant action has physical cost
   - Track exhaustion, injury, environmental impact
   - No painless combat or effortless movement

## The Embodied Perspective

### Emotion → Physical Reaction (Required)

Never report feelings directly. Always show through body.

| Emotion | Physical Manifestations |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Fear** | Throat tightening, shallow breath, cold sweat, trembling hands, stomach dropping |
| **Anger** | Jaw clenching, knuckles whitening, heat in chest, narrowed eyes, rigid posture |
| **Sadness** | Chest heaviness, burning behind eyes, tight throat, slumped shoulders |
| **Anxiety** | Restless fingers, racing heartbeat, skin prickling, dry mouth |
| **Shame** | Heat in face, gaze dropping, shoulders curling inward, urge to shrink |
| **Longing** | Ache in chest, reaching impulse, breath catching, hollow feeling |
| **Relief** | Shoulders dropping, breath releasing, tension draining, steadying |

**Rule:** If emotion word appears without physical manifestation → rewrite

---

## Sensory Standards

### Specificity Requirements

Push beyond generic to memorable, unique detail.

| Sense | Avoid | Require |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Visual** | "dark room" | "shadows pooled in corners like spilled ink" |
| **Auditory** | "loud noise" | "the shriek rang in her ears for three heartbeats after" |
| **Olfactory** | "bad smell" | "rotten-meat breath ghosted over her face" |
| **Tactile** | "cold floor" | "stone leeched heat from her feet" |
| **Taste** | "bad taste" | "copper flooded her mouth—she'd bitten her tongue" |

### Verb Selection

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| walked | strode, crept, stalked, shuffled, limped |
| ran | sprinted, tore, bolted, fled, charged |
| hit | slammed, drove, wrenched, cracked |
| said | rasped, breathed, snapped, murmured |

**Rule:** Single strong verb > multiple weak verbs + adverbs

## Banned Patterns - Quick Reference

### Structural Patterns

| Pattern | Search For | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Sequential pairs | ", then" | Rewrite as fluid motion |
| Vague interiority | "something" + verb | Name what's happening |
| Anthropomorphized silence | "silence/air" + verb | Show effect through behavior |
| Negation formula | "not X, but Y" | Commit to what it is |
| Triple-beat lists | "X. Y. Z." for emphasis | Cut to what matters |
| Staccato fragments | "Verb. Verb. Verb." | Use sparingly for climax only |
| Hedged reactions | "isn't quite" | Describe actual gesture |
| Echo-line poetics | Parallel sentences | If second adds nothing, cut it |
| Meta-narrative | "scene's not over" | Stay in character POV |
| Atmospheric opening | Weather/skyline before character | Start with character in action |
| Participle pileup | Multiple ", [verb]ing" | Vary structure (2 max in row) |
| Narrator-as-analyst | Explaining meaning | Action speaks for itself |

### Cliché Clusters

| Type | Banned Phrases | Fix |
|------|---------------|-----|
| **Gravitational** | pulled toward, drawn to, orbits, magnetic, gravity between | Show attraction through action/choice |
| **Temperature** | ice in veins, blood ran cold, warmth spread, heat pooled | Show sensation directly |
| **Impact** | like a physical blow, hit like a punch, like a freight train | Describe actual feeling in body |
| **Water/Ripple** | like a stone in still water, rippled through, stillness shattered | Show the actual effect |
| **Breaking** | cracked open, split open, shattered something, fractured | Name specific emotion |
| **Anchor/Tether** | anchored, tethered, grounded, moored, centered | Show stability through action |
| **Suspension** | hangs in the air, hangs between them | Show consequence |
| **Edge** | on the edge of something, teetering on precipice | Show actual state |

### Overused Physical Tells

**Make Character-Specific (Not Generic):**

| Body Part | Banned Defaults | Requirement |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Jaw/Face** | tightens/clenches/sets/locks, muscle jumps | Each character's distinct stress tell |
| **Throat/Breath** | bobs/works, swallows hard, catches/hitches | Unique to character psychology |
| **Eyes** | darken/go dark, pupils blown, gaze sharpens | Tied to character history |
| **Hands** | curl into fists, knuckles whiten, flex at side | Character-specific displacement |
| **Body** | spine straightens, shoulders tense, goes very still | Individual response pattern |
| **Heart/Chest** | stutters/pounds, tightens/aches, something shifts | Actual sensation described |

**Fix:** Give each character distinct stress responses. Trauma survivors show different tells than power holders.

### Vague Emotion Placeholders

**Banned:**
- something in him/her shifts/breaks/cracks/loosens
- something unnameable / something like [emotion]
- the weight of [X] settles/presses/lands
- a wave of [emotion] crashes/washes over
- [emotion] curls/coils in stomach
- feels it in bones
- the words hang between them

**Fix:** Name the specific emotion. Show the thought pattern or behavioral consequence.

### Default Intensity Markers

**Banned:**
- raw / visceral / primal / bone-deep / soul-deep
- paper-thin / gossamer-thin / razor-thin / threadbare
- worn thin / stretched to breaking

**Fix:** These affect intensity without specifying quality. Name the actual state.

### Dialogue Problems

| Issue | Banned | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Adverbs** | softly, quietly, carefully, finally, slowly, flatly, roughly | Line carries its own tone |
| **Voice descriptors** | drops/tightens/goes flat/breaks/hardens/softens | Embed tone in dialogue itself |
| **False markers** | pitched low, barely above whisper, deceptively soft, too casual | Show through action/context |

### AI Vocabulary Cluster

**Auto-flag these (statistically overrepresented in AI output):**

| Category | Banned Terms |
|----------|-------------|
| **Abstract nouns** | tapestry, landscape, interplay, intricacies, nuance, multifaceted, dynamics, framework, paradigm |
| **Verbs** | delve, foster, garner, underscore, showcase, highlight (editorial), navigate (emotions), unpack (ideas) |
| **Adjectives** | pivotal, crucial, vital, vibrant, intricate, profound, compelling, poignant, evocative, palpable |
| **Adverbs** | seemingly, arguably, notably, importantly, ultimately, fundamentally, inherently, undeniably |

**Fix:** Replace with specific, concrete language appropriate to character/scene

### Ending Clichés

**Banned:**
- And for now, that was enough. / It was a start.
- They would figure it out. Somehow.
- Nothing would ever be the same.
- Everything had changed. / Changed everything.
- In that instant, something broke forever.
- The world held its breath.

**Fix:** End on action, decision, or consequence—not summary or false profundity

### Misapplied Epic Tone

**Banned:**
- Treating every moment as climactic
- "It was only a touch, but it changed everything."
- "In that instant, [character] knew nothing would ever be the same."

**Fix:** Scale language to proportion. Not every moment is world-altering.

## Scene-Specific Guidelines

### Combat Scenes

**Must Include:**
- Positioning awareness ("back hitting earth", "pinned beneath")
- Weapon mechanics ("smooth bone of hilt", "blade could bite")
- Injury progression ("burning lines", "soaked through tunic")
- Physical exhaustion and body failure
- Environmental hazards

**Avoid:**
- Choreographed patterns (swing, dodge, attack, repeat)
- Painless violence ("effortlessly defeated")
- Omniscient awareness ("knew he was about to attack")

---

### Dialogue Scenes

**Must Include:**
- Subtext (hidden meaning underlying surface)
- Physical grounding (body language during speech)

**Avoid:**
- Identical simultaneous experience
- Generic sensations ("waves of pleasure")
- Flawless technique
- Ignoring awkwardness/adjustment

---

### Investigation Scenes

**Must Include:**
- Methodical progression (general → specific)
- Active engagement (character interacts)
- Incremental discovery (each action reveals)
- Evidence-based hypothesis

**Avoid:**
- Passive observation ("she noticed")
- Convenient discovery ("immediately found")
- Intuition-based ("had a feeling")
- Complete info appearing at once

---

### Trauma Scenes

**Must Include:**
- Involuntary shutdown (body systems failing)
- Mind-body disconnect (awareness trapped)
- Sensory hijacking (present displaced by past)
- Temporal fragmentation (past/present merging)

**Avoid:**
- Voluntary response ("decided to freeze")
- Convenient unconsciousness ("blacked out")

- Immediate recovery

---

## Erotica Guidelines

### Language Bans

**Euphemisms (Banned):**
- slick/spend/release/essence/fluids/cream (as nouns)

## Writing Process Checklist

### Before Drafting

- [ ] Vary sentence rhythm (no ", then" patterns)
- [ ] No adverbs on dialogue tags
- [ ] Character-specific physical tells (not generic)
- [ ] Plan ending on action/decision (not stillness)
- [ ] Know which scene type (combat/dialogue/intimate/etc)

### While Drafting

**If writing banned pattern:**
1. Stop
2. Consult Quick Reference table
3. Fix immediately
4. Continue

**Common mid-draft catches:**
- "Something" → Name what's happening
- ", then" → Rewrite as fluid motion
- Adverb after "said" → Can line carry own tone?
- Generic physical tell → Character-specific version
- Cliché metaphor → Describe sensation directly

### After Drafting

**Quick search-and-fix:**

1. **Structural:** ", then" / "something" / "silence [verb]" / "not X, but Y"
2. **Dialogue:** Adverbs after "said/asked" / "voice [verb]s"
3. **Physical:** jaw/throat/breath patterns (too many?)
4. **Metaphors:** Search cliché table terms
5. **AI vocab:** tapestry, delve, pivotal, notably, etc.
6. **Endings:** Check for "And for now" / stillness without consequence

**Final tests:**
- Could this line appear in any story? → Rewrite (not specific enough)
- Could this tell belong to any character? → Rewrite (not character-specific)
- Does something change because of this scene? → If no, keep drafting

## Quick Violation Scanner

**Search these exact terms in drafted response:**

**Structural:**
- ", then"
- "something"
- "silence" or "air" + action verb
- "not [X], but [Y]"
- "isn't quite"
- "for a moment" / "for a beat"
- "finally" (as transition)

**Clichés:**
- "like a" (usually precedes dead metaphor)
- "hangs in"
- "weight of"
- "pulled toward" / "drawn to"

**Physical:**
- jaw, throat, breath (check if overused)
- "pupils blown"
- "goes still"

**Dialogue:**
- "said" + ly adverb
- "asked" + ly adverb
- "voice" + action verb

**AI vocab:**
- tapestry, landscape, delve, foster
- pivotal, crucial, vibrant, profound
- notably, ultimately, fundamentally

**Endings:**
- "And for now"
- "changed everything"
- "would never be the same"

**If found:** Fix using Quick Reference tables above

## NPC Writing Rules

### Dialogue Limits
- NO monologues - NPCs pause, ask questions, react to player
- NPCs can be interrupted, misunderstand, get distracted
- 2-3 sentences max per NPC speaking turn

### Knowledge Boundaries
- NPCs only know what they could realistically know
- Check NPC docs for knowledge/secrets fields
- NPCs can be wrong, miss things, misunderstand

### Realistic Reactions
- NPCs prioritize self-interest (see NPC_System.md)
- Not everyone is helpful or friendly
- Strangers are suspicious of strangers

---

## Response Structure

### For RP Responses

1. **Acknowledge** player's action with consequences
2. **Advance** scene with NPC reactions/environmental changes
3. **Open** opportunities for player's next action
4. **End** at natural pause point (not mid-action)

### Pacing Guidelines

- **Action scenes:** Shorter responses, rapid exchange
- **Dialogue scenes:** Medium responses, conversational rhythm
- **Emotional scenes:** Longer responses, deeper processing
- **Transition scenes:** Brief, move things along

---

## Final Reminders

**The Core Fix:**

Every banned element fails because it substitutes form for content.

The corrective is always:
1. **Be specific** - What is actually happening?
2. **Be embodied** - What does the body do?
3. **Show consequence** - What changes because of this?

**If a line could appear in any story, it's not specific enough.**

**If a gesture could belong to any character, it's not character-specific.**

**If nothing changes, the scene isn't done.**
